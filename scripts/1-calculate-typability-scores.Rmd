NOTE:

For these scripts to work, you must follow the 3-step set-up instructions on the GitHub Repo's README: https://github.com/EA-Williams/The-Typability-Index/blob/main/README.md

This includes downloading Dhakal et al.'s (2018) 136M Keystrokes Dataset from https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/136Mkeystrokes/ into the required folder.

These scripts are intended to be run chunk-by-chunk rather than knit.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE) 
```

## Load libraries

```{r load_libraries}

library(tidyverse) # for tidy data
library(here) # for tidy and stable file paths
library(janitor) # for tidy variable names

```

NOTE: Can skip to third chunk to read the sentences data (wpms)



NOTE: Raw data for participant 3 not provided by original authors.

```{r get participicant id list}

data_meta <- read_tsv(here("data",
                           "dhakal_files_with_replacements_for_both_issues",
                           "metadata_participants.txt"),
                      quote = "") %>%
  # convert the names to lowercase
  clean_names()


# get the participant ids from the metadata and remove the first row/participant
# (participant 3) because this data is not available

p_ids <- as.data.frame(data_meta$participant_id[-1])
p_ids <- as.numeric(unlist(p_ids))

rm(data_meta)

```


Load each participant's raw (keystroke-level) data, then capture for each typed sentence:

* participant id
* what the sentence was
* their words per minute (wpm) for the sentence

Do it in batches of 5000 participants, then stitch together later.


```{r create participants_sentences_wpm}

# create a large dataframe that has a row for every sentence typed by every participant


# want to save data files in batches where it's not a continually growing file.
# can then bind the batches together
# do it in sets of 5000 participants
ptp_per_batch <- 5000
n_batches <- ceiling(length(p_ids) / ptp_per_batch)
ptp_n_overall <- 1
total_ptps <- length(p_ids)



# loop for the batches
for (batch in 1:n_batches) {

  ptp_n_in_batch <- 1

  # get the participant ids for this batch
  p_ids_this_batch <- p_ids[(batch * ptp_per_batch - ptp_per_batch + 1) :
                            (batch * ptp_per_batch)]

  # loop for the participants within each batch
  for (ptp_id in p_ids_this_batch) {

    # in the last batch, some will be NA, so ignore those
    if (!is.na(ptp_id))
    {

Participant with the id number 3 missing from sentences_data.

Read the batches and put them together:

```{r readBatches}

n_batches <- 34

for (batch in 1:n_batches)
{
  # read the data
  this_batch <- read_tsv(here("output",
                              "processed_data",
                              "ptps_sents_wpms",
                              str_c(
                                "ptps_sents_wpms__batch_",
                                batch,
                                "_of_34.txt")))

   # add to the running batch data

   if (batch == 1)
   {
   # if this is the first participant, the running list = their data
     full_ptps_sents_wpms <- this_batch
     
   }
   else
   {
     # otherwise add this Ps data to the running list
     full_ptps_sents_wpms <- bind_rows(full_ptps_sents_wpms, this_batch)
   }
}

# save the dataframe

rm(this_batch)

  write.table(
              full_ptps_sents_wpms,
              file = here(
                          "output",
                          "processed_data",
                          "ptps_sents_wpms",
                          "full_ptps_sents_wpms.txt"),
              sep = '\t',
              quote = FALSE,
              row.names = FALSE
              )

```

Alternatively, just load the sentences data.

```{r load_sentences_data}

full_ptps_sents_wpms <- read_tsv(here(
                          "output",
                          "processed_data",
                          "ptps_sents_wpms",
                          "full_ptps_sents_wpms.txt"))

```


Not let's create some 'mutated' versions with extra columns:

* wpm mean across the sentences for each P
* wpm sd across the sentences for each P
* wpm z-score of each sentence for each P

Then group by sentence and average the z-scores together, which is the "typability"

```{r calculate typability of dhakal set}

# typability is calculated by calculating the z-score wpm of each participant's 15 sentences, then averaging them together for each sentence. 
# so it is on average, how many standard deviations this sentence's wpm is above or below a typist's mean


sents_typabilities <- full_ptps_sents_wpms %>%
  group_by(participant_id) %>%
  mutate(
    mean_wpm_sent_ptp = mean(wpm_sent),
    sd_wpm_sent_ptp = sd(wpm_sent),
    z_wpm_sent_ptp = (wpm_sent - mean_wpm_sent_ptp) / sd_wpm_sent_ptp) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(sentence) %>%
  # for each unique sentence, calculate these things
  summarise(typability_z = mean(z_wpm_sent_ptp),
            n_typists = n()) %>%
  # sort sentences alphabetically
  arrange(sentence) %>%
  # add a sentence id based on alphabetical order
  mutate(sent_id = row_number()) %>%
  # keep only these columns in this order
  select(sent_id, sentence, typability_z, n_typists)

rm(full_ptps_sents_wpms)

# write typabilities to file

  write.table(
              sents_typabilities,
              file = here(
                          "output",
                          "processed_data",
                          "dhakal_typabilities",
                          "dhakal_typabilities.txt"),
              sep = '\t',
              quote = FALSE,
              row.names = FALSE
              )
  
# get just the sentences (and IDs) and write to file

just_sents <- sents_typabilities %>%
  select(sent_id, sentence)

  write.table(just_sents,
              file = here(
                          "output",
                          "processed_data",
                          "dhakal_sentences",
                          "dhakal_sentences.txt"),
              sep = '\t',
              quote = FALSE,
              row.names = FALSE
              )
